Project Description

The data set title is 'Data Science Salaries 2024' which was obtained from Kaggle.com. The dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of data science salary information, covering a span of five years from 2020 to 2024. The data includes various aspects related to salaries, providing a multifaceted view of compensation in the field. The dataset contains 11 variables which include job_title, experience_level, employment_type, work_models, work_year, employee_residence, salary, salary_currency, salary_in_usd, company_location, company_size. The dataset has 6,599 rows. However, we are only analyzing data science salaries in the United States. We discarded the other countries from our analysis as part of data cleaning. Given the data, we want to find out which positions in data science pay the highest, and determine whether there's a correlation between salary and work model and salary and company size.
